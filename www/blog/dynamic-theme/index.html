            <h1>Dark Reader 4: Introducing Dynamic Theme mode</h1>
            <h6>April 22, 2018</h6>

            <p>
                CSS filters faithfully served us since 2014. The idea of inverting a web page contents preserving colors hue quickly gained
                it's popularity. The solution was fast and simple, but several problems were introduced:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dark web-site parts become white.</li>
                    <li>Scrolling performance gets sluggish.</li>
                    <li>Text becomes blurred.</li>
                    <li>Popup elements disappear.</li>
                    <li>Colors get washed-out.</li>
                    <li>The whole sites are not displayed in recent Chrome and Firefox.</li>
                </ul>
                We've received thousands e-mails and reviews describing these problems. Based on your feedback we are introducing the Dynamic
                Theme mode.
            </p>
            <h3>What is the Dynamic Theme mode?</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dynamic Theme mode analyzes web-site colors and background images reducing lightness where necessary.</li>
                    <li>Makes text (or background in Light mode) of a sepia tone reducing harmful blue light.</li>
                    <li>Leaves photos colors untouched.</li>
                    <li>Doesn't disable sub-pixel rendering technology leaving text edges sharp.</li>
                    <li>It is much more performant and works fast even on mobile devices (using Firefox for Android or any Chromium
                        browser that supports extensions).</li>
                    <li>You can still adjust brightness and contrast settings.</li>
                </ul>
                To activate the Dynamic Theme mode open Dark Reader settings popup, click
                <strong>More</strong> and choose
                <strong>Dynamic</strong>. Tune your brightness and contrast settings until you feel comfortable.
            </p>
