### Activate after sunset

Thanks to [Kovács Márk](https://github.com/Kimbatt),
it is now possible to activate Dark Reader based on your current location.
If you specify your **latitude** and **longitude**,
the extension will be activated after the sunset
and deactivated after the sunrise.
You can find out your coordinates by using a service
like [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).

### Activate when system dark mode is on

Thanks to [Max Sysoev](https://github.com/ColCh)
who added an ability to activate Dark Reader based on your system preferences.
If you are using **Windows** or **macOS dark mode** and toggle it frequently,
choose this option and Dark Reader will change websites look accordingly.
